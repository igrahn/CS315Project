# CS315Project


# Overview
This project demonstrates basic **image processing algorithms** implemented from scratch using python.
It works with `.ppm` (Portable PixMap, P3) images, storing pixels as text RGB values.  

The program supports:
- **Box Blur** – smooths the image using an average kernel  
- **Sharpen** – enhances edges by increasing contrast  
- **Sobel Edge Detection** – finds edges by computing gradient magnitude  
- **Otsu Thresholding** – automatically converts a grayscale image to black-and-white
